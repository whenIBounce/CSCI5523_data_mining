## Question 1.
<ol type="a">
 <li>True. Redundant attributes receive similar
weights and do not degrade the quality of the classifier. 
However, if the number of irrelevant or reduntant attributes
is large, the learning of the ANN model may suffer from 
overfitting, leading to poor generalization performance.</li>
 <li> False. SVM and ANN does not handle very large training data sets equally well. SVN is more robust
 to the presence of a large number of irelevant and redundant attributes than other classifiers.
</li>
 <li>False.The SVM learning problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, in which efficient algorithms are available to find the global minimum of the objective function. Neural Network tend to find only locally optimum solutions. They do not always produce the same decision boundaries. </li>
